Currently in my **final year** at **Nanyang Technological University** <img src="https://github.com/TangLitEn/TangLitEn/assets/65808174/7aa82688-e9b5-4079-8a59-6b9856f7a936"  width="10" height="10">, pursuing a degree in **Electrical and Electronics Engineering⚡️** . While I embrace the idea of lifelong learning, my journey in academia has been marked by active involvement in various clubs and organizations.
