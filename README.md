# About Me 👑
👋Hello there! I'm Tang Lit En, but you can just call me LIEN👀. Currently in my **final year** at **Nanyang Technological University** <img src="https://github.com/TangLitEn/TangLitEn/assets/65808174/7aa82688-e9b5-4079-8a59-6b9856f7a936"  width="10" height="10">, pursuing a degree in **Electrical and Electronics Engineering⚡️** . While I embrace the idea of lifelong learning, my journey in academia has been marked by active involvement in various clubs and organizations.

I've had the privilege of leading different initiatives, serving as the **9th president of Garage@EEE🛠️ NTU** and the **5th president of MLDA@EEE🤖 NTU**. Throughout these roles, I've honed my leadership and project management skills. Beyond my administrative responsibilities, I thrive on getting my hands dirty and indulging in project tinkering.

What truly fuels **my passion is the world of robotics🦾 and Data Sciences💻**. Whether it's designing innovative robots or delving into the intricacies of data, I find immense joy in these realms.
