The cadet reporter training camp is a 4 days 3 nights camp where we train the new batch of cadet reporters how to become decent cadet reporters such as equip them with the skills for news report writing and also the skills to communicate and organize events.

I am the Chief Camp Coordinator where I lead a group of 10 Camp coordinators throughout the events. This role is important is that not only we need to know the events flow, we also need to take care of the safety and wellbeing of the participants and stay together throughout the night to finish the task given such as finishing the news report writing.
