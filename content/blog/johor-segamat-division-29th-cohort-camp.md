This event is an open public event where we as Sin Chew Daily Cadet Reporter will prepare a one-day fun camp for all secondary school participants to join in and have fun together. I am the president of the events, and it is also one of the first "big events" that I handle, and there are several mistakes that I had made and learn from the seniors.
